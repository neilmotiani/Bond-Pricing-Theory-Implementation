# Bond-Pricing-Theory-Implementation
Overview

This project provides an implementation of fundamental bond pricing theory, focusing on the time value of money principles. It includes functions to compute future and present values for investments under both discrete and continuous compounding models.

Features

Future Value Calculation (Discrete and Continuous): Computes the future value of an investment based on given interest rates and time duration.

Present Value Calculation (Discrete and Continuous): Determines the present worth of a future sum based on discounting techniques.
