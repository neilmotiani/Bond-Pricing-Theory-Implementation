# Bond Pricing Theory Implementation

# Overview

This project provides an implementation of fundamental bond pricing theory, focusing on the time value of money principles. It includes functions to compute future and present values for investments under both discrete and continuous compounding models.

# Features

Future Value Calculation (Discrete and Continuous): Computes the future value of an investment based on given interest rates and time duration.

Present Value Calculation (Discrete and Continuous): Determines the present worth of a future sum based on discounting techniques.

# How It Works

The implementation follows standard financial formulas to determine the present and future values of an investment using both discrete and continuous compounding methods. The model allows users to define an initial investment amount, an interest rate, and a duration in years to compute various financial projections.

# Installation & Dependencies

No external dependencies are required beyond Python's built-in math module. Ensure you have Python 3 installed before running the script.

# Expected Output

By providing an initial investment value, an interest rate, and a time duration, the script returns the calculated future and present values under both discrete and continuous compounding models, allowing users to analyze different financial scenarios.
